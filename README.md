## Create a website in React TypeScript about five places that you want to work at.

## Peer Reviewer: The website is very simple but i do really like the pink background. The links for the Nvida and Google page are both not centered like the other pages. Apart from that the site works. I would probably also round the borders of the images just to make it consistent with the text containers. Good Job!
## Peer Review: Mark Ortega


## Update: Rounded the edges of the images. Could not figure out why the links were inconsistent.
